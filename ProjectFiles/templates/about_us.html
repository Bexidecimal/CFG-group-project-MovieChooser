                    <li><strong>Rebecca:</strong> 
                    <br>Initially focused on the frontend development and integrated it with the backend components using Flask. Bex played a significant role in the project, dedicating substantial time to ensuring that all elements were user-friendly and fully functional and keeping the whole project moving.</br></li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li><strong>Dawn:</strong> 
                    <br>Focused on frontend development, working on the overall structure and layout of the site which involved designing how each page connects, determining the navigation flow, and ensuring the pages link seamlessly to provide an intuitive user experience.</br></li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li><strong>Tash:</strong> 
                    <br>I work as a Product Educator for loan management softwares and I hope to use the CFG Degree to make a career switch into a development role.</br>
                
                    <br>Plans for the project:
                        To  work on the back-end because I enjoy using Python and wanted to challenge myself. I want to implement the User class and create the connection to the database without touching SQL.</br>
                        
                    <br>What I worked on:
                        Sourcing the api and I worked on the back-end Users class, some of the related functions and methods, unnittests and some little odd jobs in the other py scripts. As well as a couple front-end tasks.</br>
                        
                    <br>What I've enjoyed:
                        Having to properly understand how all of the FE and BE components fit and work together. As well as how to properly use Git and Git commands. Collaborating on group calls has helped understand some of our problems with integrations/fixes.</br></li>
                        <br></br>

                    <li><strong>Emily:</strong>
                    <br>I contributed to the backend of the project with some input in the frontend. I developed the sign-up and login systems, implemented unit tests for these features and the database connection, and worked on debugging API interactions. On the frontend, I made small styling updates to the signup welcome page and added redirection functionality after user sign-up. I also secured database credentials using .env files.</br></li>
                    <br></br>

                    <li><strong>Amy:</Strong> 
                    <br> Prepared the project proposal, design and managing the databases, and conducted testing. She also handled some of the configuration files and implemented password security testing to ensure the application was secure and reliable</br></li>

                <p>In this project the team brought together individual strength to the project. Each of the developers collaborated on different parts of the project and worked together
            to provide coding solutions to problems. Work was completed from backend API development to front_end design and database management
            utilising the skills that individual team members had.</p>

                <strong> Highlights</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team Collaboration</strong>The team worked together to solve problems, integrate different parts of the project and watch it come together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>Reviewing the code and seeing it all working together through user friendly interface and backend functionality</li>
                    <li><strong>Use of Github</strong>Effective use of github helped for the smooth integration of code that was accessible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code Review</strong>Good reviewing strategy before merging into the main. Merge conflicts were discussed and reviewed quickly and efficiently.</li>
                </ul>

                <Strong>Challenges</Strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Team Challenges</strong> We started the project with a number of our team having withdrawn from the course after we had initially finalised the project idea</li>
                    <li><strong>Time constraints</strong> It felt as if we had a slight time disadvantage due to team members dropping out at the start and subsequently restarting the project</li>
                    <li><strong>Scandalising Conflicts</strong>  Difficulties also arose in schedules and having accessible meetings for everyone due to time constraint and work schedules.</li>
                </ul>
            <p> Despite these challenges, the project came together resulting in a cohesive, functional product.</p>
